# Practical React Js

## What is React JS?
React was developed by Facebook, released to open source community on 2013. Since then, it has been maintained by them and its use has increased. Companies like Facebook, Netflix, Uber, Airbnb and Platzi use it.

## DOM, Virtual DOM and React DOM
The Virtual DOM is an exact copy of the original site's DOM, made to improve performance and experience.
Currently, the real DOM needs to be completely updated when the site has to update some section(s). On the other hand, with React's virtual DOM, it is capable of recognizing which components are the ones that must be updated, and it will update only those components without needing to reload the whole DOM.
